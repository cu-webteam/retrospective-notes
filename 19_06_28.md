# June 28, 2019 Retrospective

## For constructive timed discussions - Lets try out [Lean Coffee](http://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/)

## Where are we at on the prevous Action Items
* [] Follow up with Mark Baumgartner about https sites regarding Varnish, making the governance clearer 
* [] Getting clarity on what is going on, what is happening and where we are at in a process by going back to and changing already identified and documented processes
* [] More deliberate sprint planning with the inclusion of "stretch goals" (tasks that can be added when developers need a break from tasks or are blocked)
* [] Review current documentation on developer workflow and process (which in the current Team Working Agreement)
* [] Creating a set of values and expectations in a new Team Working Agreement (currently in draft form)

## What went well

* TBD

## What didn't go well

* Some or all fuzzy on process?
* There are too many processes for Pull Requests or Pier Review?
* Not clear on Pull Request template. Should there be a template? Should it be in Wrike to to setup to verify a PR? 
* Either more clarity and consistency on how to perform the PR and write that in Wrike or in GitHub

## Action items

* Update Sprint Document
* Where are we on the PHPStorm license. We still want that?
* Update other documentation in our Wiki too
* Discuss a new Wrike status of "Ready for Review"
  * Suggestion: If you don't like statuses on our Sprint Board consider making your own or using a different workflow in your personal area. As long as we have statuses in common they should link up. I will verify Wrike's capability on this matter.
* Discuss the need for Blocked
* Provide walkthru of the Sprint process from developer centric POV rather than Ticket Lifecycle perspective
* Would like discuss to process for behat tests and how they are related or documented in the PR
* Compass alternative (node sass)
* Whether we want to turn off comments when commit (Sass)
* Behat for all (docker?)
