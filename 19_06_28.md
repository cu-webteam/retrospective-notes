# June 28, 2019 Retrospective

## Where are we at on the prevous Action Items
[] Follow up with Mark Baumgartner about https sites regarding Varnish, making the governance clearer 
[] Getting clarity on what is going on, what is happening and where we are at in a process by going back to and changing already identified and documented processes
[] More deliberate sprint planning with the inclusion of "stretch goals" (tasks that can be added when developers need a break from tasks or are blocked)
[] Review current documentation on developer workflow and process (which in the current Team Working Agreement)
[] Creating a set of values and expectations in a new Team Working Agreement (currently in draft form)

## What went well

* TBD

## What didn't go well

* Fuzzy on process
* There are too many processes for Pull Requests or Pier Review
* Not clear on Pull Request template
* Either more clarity and consistency on how to perform the PR and write that in Wrike or in GitHub

## Action items

* Update Sprint Document
* Discuss a new Wrike status of "Ready for Review"
* Discuss the need for Blocked
* Provide walkthru of the Sprint process from developer centric POV rather than Ticket Lifecycle perspective
