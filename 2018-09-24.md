# September 24, 2018 Retrospective 

## What went well

* Getting some of the outstanding D7 work accomplished
* Christian attended the testing session, testing went well
* Semicolons;
* Team Working Agreement
* Day of Reflection meeting, dealing with baggage
* Day of Reflection lunch (falafel is delicious)
* Pull requests and feature branch workflow

## What didn't go well

* Some of the things to be tested with UCOM weren't deployed prior to testing
* CAB did not go well due to miscommunication regarding testing the theme change
* Too many meetings, not enough time to get work done => not accounting for time out of the office/time in meetings when deciding how much work to pull into the sprint
* IT town hall
* Acquia not responding to ticket
* Day of Reflection meeting length

## Action items

* Kikki runs the retrospective from now on!!;?
* Monday meetings: Banana split safe word
* Passing of information: be as explicit as possible
* All devs should use and encourage UCOM to use the ticket template
* Put CAB in the sprint, make notes on the ticket
* Deploy a tag with approved changes to stage prior to scheduled testing meeting
* Check calendars and discuss at the beginning of the planning meeting to account for all time during the sprint when devs will not be able to actively work on tickets
* Day of Reflection - potentially a half day with a curated agenda
