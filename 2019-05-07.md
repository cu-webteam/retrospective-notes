# May 7, 2019 Retrospective 

## What went well

* Harry's first week (and change)
* Receptions and food!
* Seeing the president for Jim's send-off
* Alliance work nearly finished on-time (really close) and nothing major left
* Harry's red shoes

## What didn't go well

* Harry's dev environment (Windows and Vagrant/BLT don't mix)
* Alliance https/dns was a pain (was it Varnish)

## Action items

* Use a theme hook to change the theme based on URL (Rick said)
* Discuss approaches to Git (because we haven't done that enough) or try a different approach
