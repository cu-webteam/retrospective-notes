# October 8, 2018 Retrospective 

## What went well

* Release Notes for production changes
* Deployment documentation for D8
* Feature-branch workflow
* Creating new ticket vs. re-work when specs changed
* Productivity was high, 58 tickets completed/cancelled this sprint according to Wrike
* Task sizing and release planning
* Board game lunch
* BTM changes deployed

## What didn't go well

* Surprise student worker and confusion surrounding purpose and onboarding
* Sprint planning
* Status changes in Wrike were not kept up-to-date
* Poor/missing documentation for what has already been built in D8
* Too many meetings

## Last time

- [x] Kikki runs the retrospective from now on!!;?
- [ ] Monday meetings: Banana split safe word: _in progress_
- [ ] Passing of information: be as explicit as possible: _in progress_
- [ ] All devs should use and encourage UCOM to use the ticket template: _in progress_
- [ ] Put CAB in the sprint, make notes on the ticket: _this didn't happen_
- [x] Deploy a tag with approved changes to stage prior to scheduled testing meeting
- [x] Check calendars and discuss at the beginning of the planning meeting to account for all time during the sprint when devs will not be able to actively work on tickets
- [ ] Day of Reflection - potentially a half day with a curated agenda: _we haven't had another one yet_

## Action items

* Put CAB in the sprint by making a ticket and keeping notes on items in CAB that week. This should be added to TWA.
* Prioritization and backlog grooming should happen at the Monday meeting to prepare for Sprint planning
* Ensure statuses of tickets in Wrike are reflective of the actual status of the task. This should be added to TWA.
* Make a ticket listing missing D8 documentation. We will not have a documentation-only sprint, it will be worked on over time as we are able.
* For testing meeting: ensure testing procedure is in the ticket, and be available as necessary during the scheduled testing meeting
