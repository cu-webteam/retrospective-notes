# June 28, 2019 Retrospective

## For constructive timed discussions - Lets try out [Lean Coffee](http://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/)

## Where are we at on the prevous Action Items
* [] Follow up with Mark Baumgartner about https sites regarding Varnish, making the governance clearer 
* [] Getting clarity on what is going on, what is happening and where we are at in a process by going back to and changing already identified and documented processes
* [] More deliberate sprint planning with the inclusion of "stretch goals" (tasks that can be added when developers need a break from tasks or are blocked)
* [] Review current documentation on developer workflow and process (which in the current Team Working Agreement)
* [] Creating a set of values and expectations in a new Team Working Agreement (currently in draft form)

## What went well

* Team conversation started flowing well on the 27th with PRs and the like - like the flow is back!
* Team worked together to straighten up the Dev Task (Scrum) Board on the 27th too!
* Christian had a well formed PR in GitHub
  * Although I question the reason for two people running the visual regression tests for Backstop. Isn't one enough? computers don't make mistakes. i.e. "Run Backstopjs tests. Failures should be on the color change for "orange" buttons"

## What didn't go well

* Some or all fuzzy on process?
* There are too many processes for Pull Requests or Pier Review?
* Not clear on Pull Request template. Should there be a template? Should it be in Wrike to to setup to verify a PR? 
  * Christian had a well structured PR: [Colors are changing like it's autumn](https://github.com/cu-webteam/d8-platform/pull/274)
* Either more clarity and consistency on how to perform the PR and write that in Wrike or in GitHub

## Action items

* Update Sprint Document
* Font Awesome
* Where are we on the PHPStorm license. We still want that?
* Update other documentation in our Wiki too
* Discuss a new Wrike status of "Ready for Review"
  * Suggestion: If you don't like statuses on our Sprint Board consider making your own or using a different workflow in your personal area. As long as we have statuses in common they should link up. I will verify Wrike's capability on this matter.
* Discuss the need for Blocked
* Provide walkthru of the Sprint process from developer centric POV rather than Ticket Lifecycle perspective
* Would like discuss to process for behat tests and how they are related or documented in the PR
* Compass alternative (node sass)
* Whether we want to turn off comments when commit (Sass)
* Behat for all (docker?)
* Might consider backstop.js install locally in our project implement package.json, webpack, yarn, sass too.
  * Consider updating backstopjs document to reference inside of our project root or <project-root/tests/backstop> at the same level as behat folder.
* package.json node/npm integrations
* We didn't implement our new process this sprint but we'll get it there next sprint for sure
