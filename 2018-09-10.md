# September 10, 2018 Retrospective 

## What went well

* Work stuff went well, like the alt tag issue, SSO, and the WP site
* Christian and Nick think testing of roles went well
* Upstairs retreat - having a quiet place to work

## What didn't go well

* Lack of clarity around training plans (communication)
* Web dev meeting
* Wrike ticket - change of status blamed on Kasey (communication)
* Communication between UCOM & IT
* Bad vibes and negativity within the team
  - communication around training
  - working together on the same stuff (communication)
  - communication in general
  - UCOM flip-flopping
  - communication around testing
* Upstairs retreat - parts of the team working in different spaces (collaboration), negative for UCOM (optics)
* One shot to succeed (with the web dev meeting)

### Last Time

- [x] Nick and Christian will set a meeting and discuss training plans
- [ ] Testing tickets should explicitly state whether or not a dev will sit in with UCOM while they test
  * Christian is leading testing sessions
  * We must be adaptable
- [ ] Have a discussion/set a short meeting if there is miscommunication
  * This did not happen
- [ ] Christian will be a middle man-ager between devs and UCOM and discuss the point of contact with Kari
  * We did not discuss this action item
- [ ] Christian will follow up with Kari on first floor noise levels
  * Liz gave us a space upstairs

## Action items

* Kikki runs the retrospective from now on
* Monday meetings: Banana split safe word
* Passing of information: be as explicit as possible
* All devs should use and encourage UCOM to use the template
