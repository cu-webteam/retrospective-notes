# June 17, 2019 Retrospective 

## What went well

* Behat tests
* Max's vacation
* Abe's last week as a Web Strategist and bringing him aboard
* Pound Varnish change
* Accessbility changes (score goes way up!)
* Alliance ready to go
* Rick got ScrumMaster certification
* Omaha Drupal Meetup with Rick's presentation
* Rick has been leading scrum
* EAB/r2i meetings were informative for Rick and Christian


## What didn't go well

* CAB discussion about Varnish change (some blaming of the web devs)
* Old Gym can be really distracting (for some of us). But for the others, it's Wareham.
* Changes to the sprint caused confusion for the team
* Heated discussions within the group that were distracting for the team


## Action items

* Follow up with Mark Baumgartner about https sites regarding Varnish, making the governance clearer
* Getting clarity on what is going on, what is happening and where we are at in a process by going back to and changing already identified and documented processes
* More deliberate sprint planning with the inclusion of "stretch goals" (tasks that can be added when developers need a break from tasks or are blocked)
* Review current documentation on developer workflow and process (which in the current Team Working Agreement)
* Creating a set of values and expectations in a new Team Working Agreement (currently in draft form)
