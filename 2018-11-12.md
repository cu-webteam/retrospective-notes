# November 11, 2018 Retrospective 

## What went well

* testing uncovered issues that we hadn't seen (slider)
* Abe also picked up stuff really fast and had experience testing
* Moving upgrade of core of 7 (no issues)
* D8 upgrade in test without regressions


## What didn't go well

* Changes views in live/production (especially the machine names)
* Trying to retrofit an old, well-used and customized view with a new display 
* Jay leaving

## Action items

* SOP around adding view displays
* Jay to document the work that he's gotten done (some of this is already in Wrike--per Jay). He needs access to the d8 platform.
* Add a "revisit and investigate Slick" for the D8 repo
* Invite people to Drupal meeting: Jim Berry (Nick), Rick Sweenie (Nick), Prof. Mike Nichols (Christian)
